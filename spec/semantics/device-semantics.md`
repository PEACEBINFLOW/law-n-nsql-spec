# Device Semantics

Device-focused N-SQL queries operate on:

- `network.devices`
- `network.routes` (device → tower relationships)
- `network.patterns` (per-device patterns)

---

## 1. Basic Device Query

```sql
SELECT deviceId, deviceType, supportedGLayers
FROM network.devices
WHERE regionCode = "BW";
